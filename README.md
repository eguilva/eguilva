- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @eguilva
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning more about graph theory and the various elements of machine learning.
- Iâ€™m currently learning how to implement basic algorithms using the C language. 
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on school projects only currently (in either C or Java for now).
